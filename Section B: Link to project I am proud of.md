A project I am most proud of is: https://github.com/TarynNicole/Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-PYMC3-and-Django

It was a project I had to do in my Honours year for Advanced Machine Learning.
The project aims and instructions are in the README of the repo, as well as the Python file Heart_EDA_and_MODEL_.ipynb.
